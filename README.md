# beginner-games
Teaching myself Python is difficult using only online resources, but I found that doing as many projects as I can, however small, helps more than just writing notes. 
I found that most beginner projects that were easy enough to do were games, so while I want to build my way up to ML and AI, games help exercise a lot of the fundamentals.
With that, these are some of the first few games I have made, though some are incomplete. I may re-upload these as more complete or just improved on, but for now they are here for show and documentation.

Enjoy and please don't hesitate to offer any criticism or ideas! :)
